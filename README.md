# Create you own Arch Linux ISO with access to the ArcoLinux packages and configs

**It always starts with a what-if.**

Is it possible to adapt **archinstall** to automate the installation of ArcoLinux with the ArcoLinux configurations and all its packages, using an Arch Linux ISO and configuring it through **archinstall**?

No calamares used! We boot up just like the Arch Linux ISO.

**Arcoinstall** is a project, based on [archinstall](https://github.com/archlinux/archinstall), designed to automate the installation of **ArcoLinux** with specific configurations like e.g. **CHADWM**. This project simplifies the installation process by providing pre-configured scripts and modules tailored for advanced users who prefer a command-line-driven approach.

## Why Use Arcoinstall?

- **Customizability:** Adapt the installation process to include specific desktop environments or tiling window managers, such as CHADWM, by modifying package lists and scripts.
- **Reproducibility:** Ensure consistent system setups across multiple installations or devices.
- **CLI-First Approach:** Ideal for users who prefer command-line tools over graphical installers like Calamares.


## Features

- Pre-configured scripts for installing ArcoLinux with ArcoLinux configs and apps.
- Easy-to-edit profiles for customizing installations.
